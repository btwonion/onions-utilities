# onion's utilities
> provides utility mods for optimization and any kind of playing: Survival, Building, PVPing

## Performance
Since this modpack uses Sodium, Lithium and Phosphor it should also run on systems with low specs.

## Graphics
This modpack automatically installs [Faithful 64x](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/faithful-64x) and 
uses [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity) and [LambdaBetterGrass](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdabettergrass) for 
connected and more fitting textures.
Furthermore it removes fog via [No Fog](https://modrinth.com/mod/no_fog) and has darkmode everywhere through [Default Darkmode](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/default-dark-mode).

## Utility
This mod uses a bunch of mods which are add utilities. The most important are:
- [Perspektive](https://modrinth.com/mod/perspektive) - adds a keybind to change perspective, but don't move player's view
- [SimpleAutoDrop](https://modrinth.com/mod/autodrop) - adds ability to automatically drop items, when they're moves into the inventory
- [Chat-Heads](https://modrinth.com/mod/chat-heads) - adds player heads next to the messages in chat
(- [Mouse Wheelie](https://modrinth.com/mod/mouse-wheelie) - adds a bunch of utilites to the mouse, will be included if it adds support for quilt)
