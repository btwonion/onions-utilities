# onion's utilities
> Modpack providing utility mods for optimization and any kind of playing: Survival, Building, PVP

## Performance
Since this modpack uses [Sodium](https://modrinth/mod/sodium), [Lithium](https://modrinth/mod/lithium) you shouldn't feel any fps drops. 
<br> > If you have them anyway, try to disable the [Hyper-Realistic-Sky](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/hyper-realistic-sky) texture pack

## Graphics
This modpack automatically installs [Faithful 32x](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/faithful-32x) and 
uses [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity) for connected textures.
Furthermore it removes fog via [No Fog](https://modrinth.com/mod/no_fog) and has darkmode everywhere through [Default Darkmode](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/default-dark-mode).

## Utility
This mod uses a bunch of mods which are adding useful utilities. The most important are:
- [Perspektive](https://modrinth.com/mod/perspektive) - adds a keybind to change perspective, without changing the player's direction
- [SimpleAutoDrop](https://modrinth.com/mod/autodrop) - adds ability to automatically drop items, when they're moved into the inventory
- [Chat-Heads](https://modrinth.com/mod/chat-heads) - adds player heads next to the messages in chat
- [Mouse Wheelie](https://modrinth.com/mod/mouse-wheelie) - adds a bunch of utilites to the mouse (if you want to play on cytooxien.de disable this mod!)
- [moredetails](https://modrinth.com/mod/moredetails) - displays useful information on your ingame hud
